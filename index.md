This was planned as an alternative version of the original documentation for [Porteus Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porteus_(operating_system)), tackling readability and maintainability.

As it turned out, a limitation to few use cases should lead to quicker solutions, so the project here hibernates in favor of [myPorteusDocs](http://myPorteusDoc.github.io) 

Note that this is not an official project of Porteus, but it aims to promote Porteus.
