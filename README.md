# porteusDocs.github.io

This was planned as an alternative version of <http://porteus.org> (excluding <https://forum.porteus.org>), tackling readability and maintainability.

As it turned out, a limitation to few use cases should lead to quicker solutions, so the project here hibernates in favor of http://myPorteusDoc.github.io.

Note that this is not an official project of Porteus, but it aims to promote Porteus.
